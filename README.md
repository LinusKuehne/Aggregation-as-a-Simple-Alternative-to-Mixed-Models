# Aggregation-as-a-Simple-Alternative-to-Mixed-Models

This repo contains all the R scripts for the simulations and figures in the semester project 

  "Aggregation as a Simple Alternative to Mixed Models" 

written by Linus KÃ¼hne under the supervision of Dr. Markus Kalisch at the Seminar for Statistics.




Fig. 2.1 is generated in default_RI_vs_aggRegr.R

Fig. A.1 is generated in default_RIRS_vs_aggRegr.R

Fig. A.2 is generated in default_RI_vs_aggRegr.R and RI_violation1.R through RI_violation5.R

Fig. A.3 is generated in default_RIRS_vs_aggRegr.R and RIRS_violation1.R through RIRS_violation5.R

The simulation in Section 2.1 is run by default_RI_vs_aggRegr.R

The simulation in Section 2.2 is run by default_RIRS_vs_aggRegr.R

The simulations in Section 3.1 are run by RI_violationX.R for X in {1,2,3,4,5}

The simulations in Section 3.2 are run by RIRS_violationX.R for X in {1,2,3,4,5}
